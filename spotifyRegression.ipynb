Basically all the unique rows for the categorical data gets converted into individual columns where the value is either 1 or 0(1 if present and 0 if not).\n\nThe numerical transformer completes the scaling process for our numerical data. This helps in providing a general range for our data. It doesn't reduce the outliers that we have but rather tries to bring it all in a working legible range.
