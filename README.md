A model to predict the popularity of a song

A machine learning model that can predict the popularity of a song. Popularity is an integer value so treat this as a regression problem. Ignoring Id and Popularity (named "pop") there are 13 other attributes in the dataset that you may use to build your model. The performance of the model is determined by the RMSE.
